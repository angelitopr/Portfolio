            <h4><strong>The Basic logic of NFTS</strong></h4>
            <p class="text-muted">
              Here in NFTORIGINSTORY we want to show you what nfts are what they are capable of doing and how you can benefit from this. Lets start with the fact that NFTs are a cousin of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, and like those currencies, they’re stored on a blockchain. Blockchains are databases, with each unit of digital data a block and all the blocks chained together. Crucially, no single person has control. Instead all the users in the chain control what happens.Now comes the hash. This is a one-of-a-kind digital record of what's within the block – a fingerprint, if you will – that's formed when it's made and has a one-of-a-kind ID number. If you modify any of the data in this hash, the block will no longer be the same; it will be renamed with a new number. Finally, the hash of the chain's previous block. Keep in mind that the blocks are all linked together. Each block also contains information from the prior block, allowing the system to confirm that the number assigned to its predecessor in the chain remains the same. The chain is broken if you try to tamper with or copy the previous block. Keep in mind that this information is shared with all users and computers in the system. In the case of Bitcoin, this is the Ethereum blockchain, which has over 16,000 nodes that examine each new transaction to ensure that no one is tampering with the block. This protects the system's integrity and eliminates the risk of cryptocurrency "double-spend" (selling Bitcoins to customer A and then selling them to customer B).A transaction is only confirmed when more than half of the computers on the global network agree. As a result, a forger would have to deceive thousands of nodes at the same time. For only one transaction, this would require many times Google's present computational capacity. In practise, it's impossible, and any bank system is safer.In a blockchain, this is the initial degree of security. NFTs provide a second dimension, which is why they've proven so valuable in the sale of digital artwork. While Bitcoins are "fungible," or interchangeable, in the same way that any cash is (any Bitcoin may be swapped for another because they have the identical face value), each NFT's non-fungible data makes the piece of art unique. That implies that every computer on the massive network will constantly verify that the piece of art on the chain is the original Everydays, not a replica, and that it hasn't been tampered with. Consumers value NFTs because they know they're getting the genuine article. They're even more exciting for the producers. Artists have been treated poorly by the information economy, with their work being freely shared and reproduced. Even when portions are purchased, gatekeepers such as Spotify or Amazon scoop up the major bucks. What if there was a method for artists to bypass the intermediaries, deliver their work directly to clients, and reap the benefits? That's how digital art, also known as NFTs, works. As for the market's craziness... So, how much is anything actually worth? Why is a canvas and paint Picasso "worth" $200 million? Why do individuals accumulate gold? It's all about rarity or uniqueness, as well as provenance, which NFTs supply.

            <p><strong>How can you benefit from NFTS?</strong></p>
            <p class="text-muted">
